# CardGame-Tablic

## About
Made a card game that is played against computer. The project was written in Java and JavaFX was used for the GUI. Later, I had an opportunity to use the project in "Intelligent Systems" course at my university.

## Rules
You can find the rules of the game on this link: https://www.pagat.com/fishing/tablic.html

## Important
In Java 11, JavaFX was removed from the SDK. It is now in its own separate module, and if you want to run my application you will need to specifically include it.
