# CardGame-Tablic

Made a card game that is played against computer. 
I worked on it for a course on university. The project was written in Java, JavaFX was used for the GUI.

## Important
In Java 11, JavaFX was removed from the SDK. It is now in its own separate module, and if you want to run my application you will need to specifically include it.
